What does the following program do?

- Reference -

setInterval takes 2 parameters
- a callback function,
- a number that represents time in ms (miliseconds) after which to execute the callback (executes callback every interval until clearInterval is called)
setInterval returns a number representing the id of the interval, used to clear the interval e.g. clearInterval(id)

- Problem -

function g() {
    console.log("Hello!") // Logs the string 'Hello!"
}

function h() {
    setInterval(g, 1000); // Sets an interval for the execution of the function g
}

setInterval(h, 1000); // Sets an interval for the execution of the function h

The program will log 'Hello!' after 1000 miliseconds, than logs one more 'Hello!' after each subsequent 1000 miliseconds - 2 in the first run, 3 in the third, 4 in the fourth, and so forth indefelitely.
