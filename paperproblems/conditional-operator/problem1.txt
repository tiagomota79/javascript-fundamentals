What does this program output?

function f(x) {
    return x < 5 ? 3 : x > 8 ? 4 : x === 6 ? 12 : 9;
}

console.log(f(5));

The output is number 9.
The function would return 3 if x was smaller than 5. If not smaller than 5, it would return 4 if bigger than 8. If not bigger than 8, it would return 12 if identical to 6, otherwise, which is the case, it would return 9.
